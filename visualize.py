Anjali & Namya's Part

Goal : Basically we have to predict that how many passengers will come back and how much will be the revenue for 
       the next year i.e, 2026.

Context: In this same project open Samples/Flight.csv it is basically a dataset of Flight's revenue over the years
         ranging from 1990 to 2025

         So, Atharva will be predicting the revenue and passenger return rate for year 2025 based on data of 1990-2025.
         If you have any doubt ask me or Atharva of you are reading.

Task:
    1. Take the predicted outputs
    2. Visualize the predicted 

Possible Options to create:
        1. Check the dashboard.py in this same project folder and run it using ``python dashboard.py``
           Basically it create a server which runs on the local system and we can see beatiful and interactive dashboards there
        2. Add you options here...
